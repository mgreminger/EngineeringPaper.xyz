<h4>Support for Dummy Variables in Python Code Cells</h4>
<p>
   Certain types of functions require a variable that is local to that function that should not be substituted
   until after the function is evaluated. Examples include integration, differentiation, and summation.
   For integrals, this variable is the variable of integration. Previously it was not possible 
   to use these dummy variables in custom Python functions making it impossible to define certain integral 
   transformations including Laplace and Fourier transforms. It is now possible to use dummy 
   variables in your custom Python functions. See the 
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/F4pDST3oDsYZbU4rxSyNtZ" target="_blank">
      Custom Laplace Transform Tutorial
   </a> to see an example of using dummy variables in Python code cells.

<h4>Word and PDF Export Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Several improvements have been made to Word and PDF document exporting. Equations are now
   left justified by default. The previous behavior of centered equations is now an option. 
   The paper size for exported documents can now be specified as either A4 or Letter. 
   The size of scaled images is now carried through to the exported Word or PDF document. 
   Previously, images always appeared at their original size in the exported document file. 
   Finally, and most importantly, the PDF typesetting engine has been updated to use the 
   amazing <a href="https://typst.app/" target="_blank">Typst</a> typesetting library. 
   This results in <em>much</em> faster PDF generation, support for international 
   unicode fonts, emojis üòä‚û°Ô∏èüìÑ, and a more modern look for the PDF exports. Also, the  
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/uEeEXzYZLWyfXxyTzaWpAN" target="_blank">
      Python Extensions Tutorial
   </a> has been updated to show you how to get your Python code cell generated SVG images to 
   show up in your exported Word and PDF documents (see the last Matplotlib example
   in the tutorial).

<h4>New Matrix Slicing Notation</h4>
<p>
   EngineeringPaper.xyz now supports matrix slicing notation to extract rows 
   and/or columns from a matrix. For example
   <span class="math">{String.raw`\(A_{2,1:end}\)`}</span> extracts the 
   second row of the matrix. See the updated  
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/D3xRT3N6mXMUWE2vBsR4eZ" target="_blank">
      Matrices and Vectors Tutorial
   </a> for details. Additionally, the updated tutorial shows how to combine 
   vectors and matrices as rows, columns, or both.

<h4>New Variable Accents, International Variable Names, and Performance Improvements</h4>

<p>
  Have you ever been forced to use inconvenient variable names such as
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(DeltaF_{DoublePrime}\)`}</span>,
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(i_{hat}\)`}</span>, or <span class="math">{String.raw`\(doubleDotx_{alpha}\)`}</span> 
  in EngineeringPaper.xyz? These variables can now be more conveniently expressed as 
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(\Delta F^{\prime\prime}\)`}</span>,  
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(\hat{\imath}\)`}</span>, and 
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(\ddot{x_{\alpha}}\)`}</span>
  , respectively, since EngineeringPaper.xyz now supports variable name accents 
  such as <em>bar</em>, <em>vector</em>, <em>dot</em>, <em>double dot</em>, and <em>prime</em>. These accents are 
  available on the 
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(\hat{a}\mathrm{\smallint\Sigma}\)`}</span> 
  tab of the virtual keyboard. Previously, Greek characters could only be 
  used by themselves as variable names. Greek characters can now appear 
  anywhere, and in any combination, within a variable name or subscript. 
  Finally, and most importantly, international character sets can now be 
  used in variable names making all of the following valid EngineeringPaper.xyz expressions:
</p>

<br>
<p>
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(Èù¢ÁßØ=ÈïøÂ∫¶\cdotÂÆΩÂ∫¶\)`}</span>
</p>

<br>
<p>
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(Œï\mu\beta\alpha\deltaœå\nu=ŒúŒÆ\kappaŒø\varsigma\cdot\Pi\lambdaŒ¨\tauŒø\varsigma\)`}</span>
</p> 

<br>
<p>
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§´‡§≤=‡§≤‡§Ç‡§¨‡§æ‡§à\cdot‡§ö‡•å‡§°‡§º‡§æ‡§à\)`}</span>
</p> 

<br>
<p>
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(Î©¥Ï†Å=Í∏∏Ïù¥\cdotÎÑàÎπÑ\)`}</span>
</p> 

<br>
<p>
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(‡∏û‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà=‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ß\cdot‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏Å‡∏ß‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á\)`}</span>
</p> 

<br>
<p>
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(Èù¢Á©ç=Èï∑„Åï\cdotÂπÖ\)`}</span>
</p> 

<br>
<p>
  EngineeringPaper.xyz now supports all of the Unicode character sets that are 
  supported by 
  <a href="https://www.asmeurer.com/python-unicode-variable-names/" target="_blank">Python for variable names</a>. 
  Unfortunately, right-to-left character sets are not well supported at this time. 
  This is due to <a href="https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/issues/2544" target="_blank">some issues</a> 
  with the underlying math editor used by EngineeringPaper.xyz. Hopefully this can be addressed at some point in the future.
</p>

<br>
<p>
  This release also includes additional changes to offload the parsing of mathematical expressions to a
   different browser thread. This makes editing large or complex mathematical expressions much more responsive. 
   This change also makes editing large data tables much less laggy, which enables users to work with data tables 
   that have thousands of rows.

<h4>New Multivariable Interpolation and Polynomial Regression Features</h4>
<p>
   Data tables now support multivariable interpolation and multivariable polynomial regression making 
   it easy to perform bilinear interpolation of tabular data or to create response surfaces
   for design of experiments (DOE) data. See this 
   <a href="https://youtu.be/9SZYF__isMQ" target="_blank">
      multivariable interpolation tutorial video
   </a> for details. Additionally, this update provides significant performance improvements
   for both calculations and load times through both code improvements and by upgrading the 
   underlying Pyodide Python library.

<h4>Summation/Product Notation and Matrix Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Summation and product notation have been added. Summation or product notation can be inserted 
   using the virtual keyboard with the new 
   <span class="math">{String.raw`\(\mathrm{\smallint\infty\Sigma}\)`}</span> tab. 
   Alternatively, they can be inserted by typing the \<em>sum</em> or \<em>prod</em> keyboard 
   shortcuts. The <em>numrows</em> and <em>numcols</em> functions have been added to make it easy 
   to use the summation or product notation to loop over matrices or vectors of arbitrary size 
   (see the
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/oYAstqvgNU2nhuJKpNN2nZ" target="_blank">Matrices and Vectors Tutorial</a>
   for an example).
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Matrices can now be resized using the context menu (access the context menu using 
   right click on Windows, Ctrl-left-click on Mac, and long press on touch screen devices) 
   or by using the <span class="math">{String.raw`\(\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}\)`}</span> 
   tab on the virtual keyboard. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Finally, to accommodate these new features, the virtual keyboard tabs have been updated. 
  The <em>Math</em> tab has been renamed to 
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(123\)`}</span>. The calculus functions have 
  been moved to the new 
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(\mathrm{\smallint\infty\Sigma}\)`}</span>  tab. The statistics 
  functions have been moved to the 
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(\operatorname{f}\left(x\right)\)`}</span> tab 
  and the <em>Matrices</em> tab has been renamed to 
  <span class="math">{String.raw`\(\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}\)`}</span>.

<h4>New Documentation Cell Features</h4>
<p>
   One of the more popular features of EngineeringPaper.xyz is the ability to document your calculations 
   using documentation cells. This release adds frequently requested features to documentation cells. 
   First, you are now able to add mathematical expressions to documentation cells using either the formula 
   button in the toolbar or using the {modifier}-E keyboard shortcut. You enter your equations using 
   <a href="https://www.reed.edu/academic_support/pdfs/qskills/latexcheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">LaTeX mathematial notation</a>.
   Don't know LaTeX, no problem! You can simply copy the mathematical expression from one of the math 
   fields in your EngineeringPaper.xyz and paste it into the formula field, it will be in LaTeX format since 
   EP uses LaTeX as its native math format. Second, you're now able to set the text color and text highlight color 
   in documentation fields. Finally, you can now resize images using the resize handles that appear 
   when you click on images in your documentation fields.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   This release has many behind the scenes changes that modernize the user interface libraries and code.
   Much effort has went into making sure that these changes do not introduce bugs, however, 
   if you do notice a bug, please report the 
   bug to <a href="mailto:support@engineeringpaper.xyz">support@engineeringpaper.xyz</a>
   In the meantime, you may use the previous release's permalink (see below) until the bug is fixed.

<h4>Updated Dimension Handling System</h4>
<p>
   The logic for dimension handling has been significantly revised and improved. The most significant benefit of this update
   is improved error messages for dimension errors. Instead of just getting the dreaded <em>Dimension Error</em> message, 
   some context about the operation or function that lead to this error is included in the error message. This update also 
   makes calculations faster in general, provides more robust handling of dimensions that are slightly different due to floating 
   point rounding errors, and makes it easier to maintain and extend the dimension handling code in the future. This update 
   is required to enable some significant new features that are coming your way!
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Significant testing has gone into ensuring that this change does not introduce bugs. One change you may notice is that dimensions
   were sometimes lost in the past for dimensioned values that had zero magnitude. This should no longer happen 
   but may lead to dimension errors for sheets that relied on the old behaviour. If you do notice a bug, please report the 
   bug to <a href="mailto:support@engineeringpaper.xyz">support@engineeringpaper.xyz</a>
   In the meantime, you may use the previous release's permalink (see below) until the bug is fixed.

<h4>New Release Permalinks</h4>
<p>
   New releases of EngineeringPaper.xyz roll out on a continuous basis. Because of this, if you go to 
   the main EngineeringPaper.xyz site, you always get the most recent version
   with all of the newest features and bug fixes. This is also true for the alternative mirror addresses: 
   <a href="https://epxyz.com" target="_blank">epxyz.com</a> and 
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.com" target="_blank">EngineeringPaper.com</a>.
   Most of the time, this is what you want. However, there may be cases where you may want to use a 
   specific release. If you find the updates distracting, using one of the release permalinks will allow
   you to avoid updates until you're ready. Additionally, in the event that a new version introduces 
   a bug that is impacting your sheet, going back to a previous permalink will allow you to open your <em>.epxyz</em> 
   file and keep working. Of course, if this happens, please report the bug to 
   <a href="mailto:support@engineeringpaper.xyz" target="_blank">support@engineeringpaper.xyz</a> so that we can 
   get it fixed. A lot of effort is put into ensuring that new versions don't introduce bugs. However, 
   a bug is always possible and ensuring that you're able to work with your existing sheets is a top 
   priority.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   For this, and all future releases, a permalink will be listed after the release date in this dialog 
   (for this release, the permalink is: 
   <a href="https://20250116.engineeringpaper.xyz" target="_blank">20250116.engineeringpaper.xyz</a>).
   This dialog can be accessed by clicking on the "Releases" entry in the left menu. The release permalinks will also 
   be available on the 
   <a href="https://github.com/mgreminger/EngineeringPaper.xyz/releases" target="_blank">EngineeringPaper.xyz GitHub site</a>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   As you might expect, the introduction of permalinks is in anticipation of new releases coming your way. 
   In the short term, most of the changes are related to updates to the internal structure of 
   EngineeringPaper.xyz. These updates are important to modernize and simplify the code that backs 
   EngineeringPaper.xyz and will pave the way for exciting new features in the future. Stay tuned!
</p>

<br>

<em>November 23, 2024</em>
<h4>New Custom Default Sheet Settings Feature</h4>
<p>
   You can now set your own custom default sheet settings (default units, default number 
   formating, etc.). These defaults will be used whenever you create a new sheet 
   and these settings can also be applied to existing sheets. All of this functionality 
   is accessible through the "Set User Default" tab of the "Sheet Settings" 
   dialog (available using the sheet settings button <SettingsAdjust size={16}/> 
   at the top toolbar).
</p>

<br>

<em>November 2, 2024</em>
<h4>Matrix Multiplication Improvements</h4>
<p>
   The two multiplication symbols (the dot symbol obtained using the * key and the x symbol
   obtained using the @ key) can now be used interchangeably and will correctly apply
   either scalar or matrix multiplication as appropriate for the situation. 
   Previously, the dot symbol would give unexpected results for some matrix 
   multiplication situations. The only difference between the two symbols is that the 
   x multiplication symbol will automatically perform a cross product when operating on 
   compatible vectors (both 3x1 or both 1x3). This cross product behavior is unchanged from 
   previous versions. This update also fixes some situations where the result of a
   matrix multiplication passed to a function would cause an error.
</p>

<br>

<em>August 27, 2024</em>
<h4>PDF Export Improvements</h4>
<p>
   The reliability of PDF export has been greatly improved. Images that previously caused errors are now
   reproduced correctly in the generated PDF files. International fonts that previously caused errors no longer cause errors. 
   However, some international fonts are still not rendered properly in the generated PDF. 
   For full international font support, exporting to Word DOCX files or using the browser's print to PDF function are still your
   best options. 
</p>

<br>

<em>August 24, 2024</em>
<h4>Scientific Notation Improvements</h4>
<p>
   A frequent point of confusion was the lack of support for units immediately following
   a number expressed in scientific notation. Units now work as expected when used with
   scientific notation (see image below). Additionally, the {modifier}-E keyboard shortcut 
   can be used to insert scientific notation and a new scientific notation button has been
   added to the virtual keyboard.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   New scientific notation with units support:
   <img src="images/updates/scientific_notation.png" width="{253*0.5}px" height="{64*0.5}px" alt="Math cell shown with scientific notation number with units">
</p>

<br>

<em>August 18, 2024</em>
<h4>New Show Intermediate Results Feature</h4>
<p>
   A new sheet setting has been added (available using the settings button <SettingsAdjust size={16}/> 
   at the sheet level or at the math cell level) that will automatically show intermediate results for 
   a calculation. This feature is best shown with an example: 
</p>

<br>
<p>
   Result with Show Intermediate Results setting disabled (default):
   <img src="images/updates/result_no_intermediate.png" width="{474*0.5}px" height="{94*0.5}px" alt="Math cell with Show Intermediate Results setting disabled">
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Result with Show Intermediate Results setting enabled:
   <img src="images/updates/result_with_intermediate.png" width="{954*0.5}px" height="{94*0.5}px" alt="Math cell with Show Intermediate Results setting enabled">
</p>
<br>

<p>
   This feature is useful for debugging results with a dimension error since it will highlight
   if one of the input values is the source of the dimension error. Additionally, this feature 
   is useful in an educational context where including intermediate results may make it easier
   to evaluate a student's work or it may make it easier for a 
   student to follow along with an example problem.
</p>

<br>

<em>August 13, 2024</em>
<h4>Data Table Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Spreadsheet files (Excel or CSV files) can now be dragged and dropped onto a 
   EngineeringPaper.xyz page to automatically add a new data table cell to the 
   current sheet. A new button, <RowCollapse size={16}/>,
   has also been added to the lower right of the data table that makes it easy to 
   remove empty rows.
</p>

<br>

<em>August 8, 2024</em>
<h4>Data Table Feature Added</h4>
<p>
   EngineeringPaper.xyz can now do spreadsheets with Excel and CSV import! Additionally,
   the min and max functions have been updated to work with vectors and new functions
   geared towards working with data have been added (sum, average, 
   stdev, stdevp, range, and count).

   <li>Reduced loading time and memory usage for large sheets</li>
   <li>Improved performance when editing sheets with a large number of table cells or piecewise expression cells</li>
</ul>

<br>

<em>April 18, 2024</em>
<h4>Maximum Matrix Columns Limit Increased</h4>
<p>
   The maximum number of columns allowed in a matrix has been increased to 50. 
   The previous limit was 10. The number of rows allowed is unlimited, however, 
   performance may become sluggish with large matrices.
</p>

<br>

<em>April 6, 2024</em>
<h4>Drag to Reorder Cells Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Using the mouse or touch actions to drag and reorder cells has been improved 
   and no longer has issues after repeated drag events.
</p>

<br>

<em>April 4, 2024</em>
<h4>Differentiation and Integration Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Integration and differentiation now support piecewise functions. These updates 
   will also fix situations that led to dimension errors when performing
   integration and differentiation on expressions that used certain builtin functions 
   such as the min and max functions.
</p>

<br>

<em>March 24, 2024</em>
<h4>Differentiation and Integration Bug Fixes</h4>
<p>
   Two bugs that occur in certain situations when performing substitutions
   with 
   <a href="https://github.com/mgreminger/EngineeringPaper.xyz/issues/156" target="_blank">derivatives</a>
   and
   <a href="https://github.com/mgreminger/EngineeringPaper.xyz/issues/244" target="_blank">integrals</a>
   have been fixed. This fix also has the benefit of speeding up calculations for sheets that
   make use of derivatives or integrals.
</p>

<br>

<em>March 21, 2024</em>
<h4>Custom Right Click Context Menu Added</h4>
<p>
   Math fields in EngineeringPaper.xyz now support a custom context menu for 
   Cut/Copy/Paste, Undo/Redo, Select All, and Delete functionality. The context 
   menu can be opened using the standard shortcuts for your system (right click
   on Windows, Ctrl-left-click on Mac, and long press on touch screen devices). Note
   that on iOS devices, the long press doesn't always work due to a bug in Safari.
   For these situations, a menu button ‚â° has been added to the onscreen keyboard
   in order to ensure access to the context menu on all systems. 
</p>

<br>

<em>February 27, 2024</em>
<h4>Save As Shortcut Added and Shareable Link Shortcut Changed</h4>
<p>
   When using Chrome, or a Chrome based browser such as Edge, hitting {modifier}-S 
   will automatically re-save the file using the same name, if it has already been 
   saved. The {modifier}-Shift-S keyboard shortcut can now be used to perform a Save As 
   operation to allow you to choose a different file name. Additionally, the Save Document 
   menu now includes a Save As checkbox to serve the same purpose. The {modifier}-Shift-S 
   keyboard shortcut was previously used to save your document as a shareable link. The 
   {modifier}-L keyboard shortcut can now be used the create a shareable link. 
</p>

<br>

<em>February 26, 2024</em>
<h4>File Saving Improvements</h4>
<p>
   When using Chrome, or a Chrome based browser such as Edge, the file saving experience has been
   improved. Hitting {modifier}-S on the keyboard will prompt you to choose the file name and location
   for the first save. For future saves, the file will be automatically replaced when you hit
   {modifier}-S. If you would like to save the file as a different name, simply change the sheet title
   and you'll be prompted to choose a new file name the next time you hit {modifier}-S. Another 
   option to save as a different file name without changing the sheet title is to disable the file
   saving permission using the browser's address bar. These options are covered in this

<h4>Microsoft Word, PDF, and Markdown Export</h4>
<p>
   You're now able to export your EngineeringPaper.xyz sheets as Microsoft Word,
   PDF, or Markdown files. Use the save icon <Download size={16}/> on the top 
   toolbar to access this exciting new feature. Since the Word and PDF 
   conversions cannot be performed in the browser, data needs to be sent 
   to the EngineeringPaper.xyz servers to complete the conversion process. However, no 
   data is retained after the document conversion process is complete. The Markdown 
   document export option does not require sending any data to the EngineeringPaper.xyz 
   servers. Enjoy!

<h4>Now Also Available as <a href="https://epxyz.com" target="_blank">EPxyz.com</a></h4>
<p>
   Some environments indiscriminately block all <em>.xyz</em> domains. For example,
   some school districts block all <em>.xyz</em> domains for their school issued 
   Chromebooks. Since it's important to us that all of the EngineeringPaper.xyz
   goodness is available to everyone, the full functionality of EngineeringPaper.xyz 
   is now also available as a <em>.com</em> address at
   <a href="EPxyz.com" target="_blank">EPxyz.com</a>. The functionality is the same
   between the two domains and sheets saved on one can be opened on the other. 
   Shareable links are interchangeable as well. For example, 
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/fFjTsnFoSQMLwcvteVoNtL" target="_blank">
      https://engineeringpaper.xyz/fFjTsnFoSQMLwcvteVoNtL</a> and 
   <a href="https://epxyz.com/fFjTsnFoSQMLwcvteVoNtL" target="_blank">
      https://epxyz.com/fFjTsnFoSQMLwcvteVoNtL</a> point to the same sheet.
</p>

<h4>New Default Units Feature</h4>
<p>
   The default base units used for results can now be set in the sheet settings dialog. 
   To access the base unit settings, click on the sheet settings 
   icon <SettingsAdjust size={16}/> in the top menu bar and then click on the 
   <em>Default Units</em> tab. The default units settings will be saved with the sheet.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   As in the past, the default unit system for EngineeringPaper.xyz sheets is the 
   SI unit system. The default unit symbols now all correspond to the official 
   SI unit symbols (for example, the time unit now defaults to <em>s</em> rather 
   than <em>sec</em>). However, all of the old unit symbols still work for user 
   specified units.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Finally, the inverse time unit, <em>1/s</em>, is no longer automatically converted to
   <em>Hz</em> since this behavior was confusing when the frequency unit should have been
   interpreted as <em>rad/s</em>. See this 
   <a href="https://blog.engineeringpaper.xyz/calculating-the-natural-frequencies-of-a-cantilever-beam"
      target="_blank">
   blog post</a> for details on how to properly
   handle frequency units in EngineeringPaper.xyz.

<h4>New Scatter Plotting Feature</h4>
<p>
   Scatter plots are now supported by EngineeringPaper.xyz. Scatter plotting
   leverages the recently added ability to define vectors. See the 
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/32XmqQA442GL8mj8X9uwP3" target="_blank">
   Scatter Plotting Tutorial</a> for details. 
</p>

<br>

<em>October 31, 2023</em>
<h4>New <em>ceil</em>, <em>floor</em>, and <em>round</em> Functions Have Been Added</h4>
<p>
   Three new rounding functions have been added. <em>ceil</em> to round up, 
   <em>floor</em> to round down, and <em>round</em> to round to the nearest integer.
   These new functions can be found on the f(x) tab of the virtual keyboard.
   Note that these functions require that the input parameter is unitless. An input
   with units would lead to unexpected results since all calculation are performed
   internally in base SI units. For example, calculating the <em>floor</em> of
   1 [mm] would evaluate to zero since the floor would be calculated on 0.001 after 
   the millimeter value is converted to meters for the internal calculation.
</p>

<br>

<em>September 30, 2023</em>
<h4>Improved Error Messages</h4>
<p>
   The error messages for syntax errors have been improved for some common errors that
   can be difficult to detect by looking at the expression. Specifically, 
   the error message will indicate if there is an empty subscript or superscript or if 
   there is a missing multiplication symbol. Note that not all missing multiplication symbols
   are able to be detected, but many common situations are covered by the new error messages.
</p>

<br>

<em>August 19, 2023</em>
<h4>Matrices and Python Code Generation Features</h4>
<p>
   This release adds matrix and vector support. Just like all of the capabilities in EngineeringPaper.xyz, 
   matrix and vector support is designed to be intuitive and easy to use and you'll get a long way by exploring
   the new "Matrices" tab on the onscreen keyboard. You can also check out the new 
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/8pWM9yEqEPNntRBd6Jr9Sv" target="_blank">Matrices and Vectors Tutorial</a> 
   to see all of the details. And, of course, all of the matrix and vector functionally has full units support.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   If you're finding the need to do more in depth numerical analysis with your EngineeringPaper.xyz calculations, 
   the new automatic Python code generation feature is for you! Check out the details in the new
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/enYmu2PzN2hN93Avizx9ec" target="_blank">Python Code Generation Tutorial</a>. 
   And, you guessed it, the Python code generation is units aware and will use whatever units you specify in your 
   EngineeringPaper.xyz sheet!
</p>

<br>

<em>July 2, 2023</em>
<h4>Minor Updates</h4>
<p>
   This is a minor release that includes the following usability improvements:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Math editor updates: hitting the ( key on a selection will enclose the selection in parenthesis, more consistent behavior when hitting the / key</li>
   <li>In addition to the Escape key, clicking the left or right page margins, or top of page logo, unselects all cells</li>
   <li>{modifier}-UpArrow now selects the last cell if no cells are selected (previously selected the first cell like {modifier}-DownArrow)</li>
   <li>A EngineeringPaper.xyz link can be dragged and dropped onto page to open (similar to existing functionality for files)</li>
   <li>If the drag and drop target becomes stuck, it can be clicked to clear (Escape key works as well)</li>
   <li>The browser spell checker is only enabled for the currently selected cell (Safari does not support this feature)</li>
   <li>The <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/VteDKCkA8fREy7hLYLMwEQ" target="_blank">tutorial page</a> has been updated for recent features and now points to the <a href="https://youtu.be/r7EZQVhcr5Q" target="_blank">new and updated tutorial video</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h4>Plotting Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Several plotting improvements have been rolled out. The main change is that the axis labels
   and legend labels have been updated to render as math so that subscripts, Greek characters,
   and units appear the same in plots as they appear in math fields. This makes plot labels
   much easier to read, especially when there are complex units. See the example below to see the different between 
   the old style plots and the new style plots. Plots can now be saved as SVG files, in addition
   to PNG files, using the buttons that appear above the plots.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Old Plots:
   <img src="images/updates/old_plot.png" width="534px" height="304.5px" alt="Old plot styling screenshot">
</p>
<br>
<p>
   New Plots:
   <img src="images/updates/new_plot.png" width="565.5px" height="312.5px" alt="New plot styling screenshot">
</p>
<br>

<p>
   Additionally, the keyboard responsiveness of the app for
   large sheets with many plots has been improved. Finally, plots opened from the side menu 
   now resize properly when the side menu is closed.
</p>
<br>



<em>June 7, 2023</em>
<h4>Custom Number Formatting</h4>
<p>
   The formatting used for numerical output is now customizable, both at the sheet
   level and at the individual math cell level. The number formatting can be set by 
   clicking on the settings icon <SettingsAdjust size={16}/> at the top tool bar
   for sheet wide settings and at the right hand side of the math cell for 
   math cell level settings. Math cell level settings will always take precedence
   over sheet level settings. When settings differ from the default settings, a 
   green dot will appear on the settings icon. Examples of the notation
   options available are shown below.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Default notation:
   <img src="images/updates/default-number-formatting.png" width="457.5px" height="45.5px" alt="Default Number Formatting Screenshot">
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Fixed notation with one significant figure after the decimal point:
   <img src="images/updates/fixed-number-formatting.png" width="442.5px" height="46.5px" alt="Fixed Number Formatting Screenshot">
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Scientific notation with four significant figures:
   <img src="images/updates/scientific-number-formatting.png" width="442.5px" height="46.5px" alt="Scientific Number Formatting Screenshot">
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Engineering notation with four significant figures:
   <img src="images/updates/engineering-number-formatting.png" width="442.5px" height="46.5px" alt="Scientific Number Formatting Screenshot">
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Symbolic notation:
   <img src="images/updates/symbolic-number-formatting.png" width="442.5px" height="46.5px" alt="Symbolic Number Formatting Screenshot">
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Additionally, the precision of the numerical computations has been increased
   to 64 significant figures. Note that some unit conversions occurs at standard
   floating point precision (this occurs when using non-SI units and when 
   converting between radians and degrees). This issue will be addressed in future
   updates.

<h4>Math Editor Change and Features for More Compact Sheets</h4>
<p>
   Up until this time, EngineeringPaper.xyz has been using the MathQuill 
   math editor component. This editor worked well but is no longer being 
   actively supported and has some limitations that has limited what features
   can be implemented in EngineeringPaper.xyz. Specifically, MathQuill does
   not support vectors and matrices. To enable the future advancement of 
   EngineeringPaper.xyz, the math editor has been updated to use the 
   <a href="https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/" target="_blank">MathLive</a> math 
   editing component. MathLive is under active development and supports 
   many advanced math constructs, such as vectors and matrices.  
   You will notice differences in how the equations look in your existing 
   sheets. In general, MathLive uses a more modern font set 
   and renders equations more clearly. We have aimed to keep the editing 
   experience as close to the same as possible. One change is the shortcut 
   for the square root symbol. Simply type "sqrt(" to create the square 
   root symbol. Alternatively, you can use the onscreen keyboard to insert a square
   root symbol.   
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Extensive testing has been done to ensure that your existing sheets will 
   still work without needing any updates. If you do run into issues with 
   your existing sheets, this is a bug and should be reported to 
   <a href="mailto:support@engineeringpaper.xyz">support@engineeringpaper.xyz</a>, 
   submitted as an issue on the 
   <a href="https://github.com/mgreminger/EngineeringPaper.xyz/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issues page</a>,
   or reported on the
   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringPaperXYZ/" target="_blank">Reddit community page</a>. 
   In the case that you are having a issue opening an existing sheet or working with the math 
   editor, the previous version of EngineeringPaper.xyz will remain available at 
   <a href="https://classic.engineeringpaper.xyz" target="_blank">classic.engineeringpaper.xyz</a>. 
   Keep in mind that sheets created in this and later versions of EngineeringPaper.xyz 
   will not open in classic.engineeringpaper.xyz
</p>
<br>
<p>
   This switch to a new math editor would not be complete without adding some 
   new features. In the past, sheets tended to use up a lot of vertical space 
   since each new assignment, each query, and each comment needed its own cell.
   An assignment and query can now be combined into one statement as shown in 
   the image below:
   <img src="images/updates/combined-assignment-query.png" width="306.5px" height="48px" alt="Combined Assignment and Query Statement Screenshot">   
   Additionally, multiple assignments can be be made in a math cell by separating
   them by commas:
   <img src="images/updates/multiple-assignments.png" width="315.5px" height="33.5px" alt="Multiple Assignments in a Single Math Cell Screenshot">   
   Finally, comments can be added at any location within a math field by pressing
   the quotation mark key to toggle comment mode on and off. The <em>Comment</em> button on the
   <em>ABC</em> or <em>abc</em> panels of the onscreen keyboard may also be used to
   toggle comment mode. Comments may be added at any point within a math expression 
   and will automatically be ignored (see example below). This is a capability directly enabled by 
   switching to the MathLive math editor.  
   <img src="images/updates/math-comments.png" width="245px" height="51px" alt="Comments in a Math Field Screenshot">

<h4>Load Time and Calculation Speed Improvements</h4>
<p>
   The version of Python that EngineeringPaper.xyz uses for calculations, via the Pyodide project,
   has been updated to Python 3.11. This update provides significant speed improvements for 
   both calculations and initial Pyodide load time. The initial Pyodide load time is 
   about half of what it was for the Python 3.10 version of EngineeringPaper.xyz. Enjoy!
</p>
<br>

<em>April 5, 2023</em>
<h4>Bug Fix Update</h4>
<p>
   There were a few cases where valid variable names would cause an error since they were reserved names in Python
   or SymPy. This issue has been fixed.
</p>
<br>

<em>March 10, 2023</em>
<h4>Usability Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Some improvements have been made to EngineeringPaper.xyz's handling of syntax errors.
   First of all, blank math cells are no longer considered a syntax error. Second, a syntax
   error in the current math field does not cause all of the results to disappear. Both of 
   these changes allow users to maintain visibility to existing results as they enter 
   new math expressions. Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/VanHulleOne">@VanHulleOne</a> for
   suggesting these usability improvements as
   <a href="https://github.com/mgreminger/EngineeringPaper.xyz/issues">
   GitHub issues</a>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   As a community project, EngineeringPaper.xyz depends on feedback from its users. If you 
   have a feature request or are experiencing a bug, there are multiple ways to report these 
   issues. You can create an issue in EngineeringPaper.xyz's 
   <a href="https://github.com/mgreminger/EngineeringPaper.xyz/issues">GitHub issues page</a>, 
   you can add a post to EngineeringPaper.xyz's 
   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringPaperXYZ/">Reddit community page</a>, or you
   can send a email to <a href="mailto:support@engineeringpaper.xyz">support@engineeringpaper.xyz</a>.
   Also, if you would like to share any of the sheets you are creating with 
   EngineeringPaper.xyz, the  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringPaperXYZ/">Reddit community page</a> is a great 
   place to share and start a discussion.

<em>February 13, 2023</em>
<h4>EngineeringPaper.xyz Can Now be Installed on Desktop or Mobile Devices</h4>
<p>
   EngineeringPaper.xyz is now a progressive web application (PWA). The biggest impact of this 
   change is that EngineeringPaper.xyz will now work without an internet connection 
   (offline functionality becomes available after the first time you load the page in your web 
   browser). Another benefit of PWAs is that they can be installed as a native application 
   on your computer or mobile device. The exact instructions will depend on your operating system and 
   device type. 
   See this 
   <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/content/hearingloss/installPWA.html" target="_blank">
    NIOSH writeup on how to install a PWA
   </a>for further details. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Another benefit of this change will be smoother rollouts of updates to EngineeringPaper.xyz. 
   In the past, it was possible for various components of EngineeringPaper.xyz to become temporarily
   out of sync as updates were rolled out globally. EngineeringPaper.xyz will now only incorporate an
   update when all components are guaranteed to be in sync. This 
   will eliminate the brief instability that occasionally occurred with previous updates. A green 
   refresh icon will appear in the toolbar when an update is available. In order to apply the update,
   all tabs and windows of EngineeringPaper.xyz need to be closed. Using the refresh button is not 
   sufficient to apply the update. It is safe to continue using the app while an update is pending.
</p>
<br>


<em>January 16, 2023</em>
<h4>Open Source Release and Local File Saving</h4>
<p>
   To ensure that EngineeringPaper.xyz always remains free to use, it has now been released as open source 
   software under the permissive MIT license. The source code can be found on the
   <a href="https://github.com/mgreminger/EngineeringPaper.xyz" target="_blank">
    EngineeringPaper.xyz GitHub page
   </a>. With this 
   change, you can rest assured that EngineeringPaper.xyz will always be available and that your
   time invested in using this software will not be wasted. No other engineering calculation software
   can make this promise. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
   This release also adds a local file open and file save feature. The buttons for this new functionality
   are on the top toolbar. This allows you to save your sheets to your local drive. With this capability, 
   along with the open source license of EngineeringPaper.xyz, you are assured that you will always have
   access to the calculations you create in EngineeringPaper.xyz. The {modifier}-S keyboard shortcut
   now saves your current sheet locally. To {modifier}-Shift-S keyboard shortcut is now used to
   create a shareable link (this was the previous behavior of the {modifier}-S shortcut).
   The {modifier}-O keyboard shortcut can be used to open a local file. Finally, the 
   {modifier}-Shift-N key starts a new blank sheet. EngineeringPaper.xyz sheets have an .epxyz 
   extension by default. Another way to open your saved sheets is to drag and drop them
   onto the EngineeringPaper.xyz window.
</p>
<br />


<em>December 29, 2022</em>
<h4>Printing Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Many updates have been made to improve printing of EngineeringPaper.xyz sheets. Document flow issues
   have been fixed where items may have previously overlapped. All unnecessary user
   interface buttons and controls are now hidden when printing. Scroll bars no longer appear in printouts.
   Finally, plot sizing when printing has been improved.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   Plots have been visually improved as well. The issue where the y-axis labels occasionally overlap the
   axis numbers has been fixed. Plot sizing has been improved on desktop and mobile. Finally, the 
   plot legend is now placed horizontally below the plot for more efficient usage of screen space 
   on desktop and mobile. 
</p>
<br />

<em>December 26, 2022</em>
<h4>Autosave Checkpoints</h4>
<p>
   EngineeringPaper.xyz now automatically saves checkpoints of your sheet to prevent loss of data in the event
   that you accidentally navigate away from an unsaved sheet, accidentally refresh your page,
   or your browser window crashes. If you accidentally navigate away from your sheet, simply use the browser's
   back button to get back to your unsaved sheet. These autosave checkpoints are saved locally to your computer
   and can only be accessed on the computer, and the browser, where 
   they were generated. In order to share your sheets with others, and to ensure future access to your work,
   you will still need to manually save your sheet using the upload button on the top right of the page or
   using the {modifier}-S keyboard shortcut.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   The checkpoints are saved every 10 seconds (only if there have been changes to your sheet). Because of this, you
   can use the browser's back button to undo recent changes you've made to your sheet.
</p>
<br>
<p>
   These autosave checkpoints are saved in your browser's local storage. Keep in mind that some browsers 
   (Safari in particular) can be fairly aggressive about cleaning up local storage so make sure to 
   manually save any sheets that you need access to in the future. See the side menu on the left for the 
   "Enable Persistent Local Storage" option to request that your browser persists the data stored by 
   EngineeringPaper.xyz.
</p>
<br />


<em>December 8, 2022</em>
<h4>Improved iPhone and Android Support</h4>
<p>
   The experience of using EngineeringPaper.xyz on iPhone and Android devices has been improved significantly. 
   Specifically, the on-screen keyboard has been expanded to provide access to all controls and symbols
   required to edit math equations on mobile. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
   The improvements are not just for mobile users. The use of screen space has been improved on both
   mobile and desktop. The on-screen keyboard now includes quick access to commonly used 
   units, eliminating the need to type them in. Finally, by placing the onscreen keyboard at the bottom 
   of the screen, the issue of missed mouse clicks because of the on-screen keyboard appearing or
   disappearing has been eliminated. 
</p>
<br />


<em>November 15, 2022</em>
<h4>New Complex Number Functions and Trig Function Updates</h4>
<p>
   <strong> Potentially Breaking Change:</strong> The inverse trig functions (arctan, arcsin, and arccos) now
      return values with the units of angle (radians by default but can be converted to degrees). If you 
      have sheets that relied on the previous behavior, where the inverse trig functions return unitless 
      values, you can multiple those values by <em>(1 [1/rad])</em> to return to the previous
      behavior. 
   
</p>
<br />
<p> <em>New Features:</em> The complex number support has been improved with
   EngineeringPaper.xyz with the addition of the real, imag, conj, and angle functions
   (see the Imag tab added to the onscreen keyboard to access these new functions). If you prefer to learn
   by example, check out this <a href="https://blog.engineeringpaper.xyz/plotting-gain-and-phase-for-a-general-voltage-divider" target="_blank">
      blog post</a> that uses these new capabilities to analyze a voltage divider with
   reactive electrical components
</p>
<br />
<p><em>Bug Fixes and Improvements:</em> The error handling for plots has been overhauled 
to provide more helpful error messages to help in debugging common plotting issues.</p>
<br />


<em>November 2, 2022</em>
<h4>Infinite Undo/Redo Feature Added for Math Fields</h4>
<p>
   {modifier}-Z and {modifier}-Y can now be used to Undo/Redo edits in a math field. Note that the Undo/Redo 
   funcitonality is local to the currently selected math or text field. When a sheet is saved and reloaded, the 
   undo history will be lost.
</p>
<br />

<em>October 28, 2022</em>
<h4>New Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
<p>
   A comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts have been added to EngineeringPaper.xyz that allow you to 
   navigate your sheet, add and remove cells, and save your work, all without 
   leaving your keyboard. See the new keyboard shortcuts button on toolbar at the top of the app 
   or see this 
   <a href="https://blog.engineeringpaper.xyz/engineeringpaperxyz-keyboard-shortcuts" target="_blank">
      blog post</a>. There's also a <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/sld1dXyx7Tw" target="_blank">tutorial video.</a>
</p>
<br />


<em>October 17, 2022</em>
<h4>Number of Plot Points Can Now be Specified</h4>
<p>
   The number of points used for a plot defaults to 51. The number of points can now be specified 
   by appending the plot function call with "with 500 points"
   to obtain a plot with 500 points, for example. This new feature is easiest shown by example,  
   see bottom of the <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/TxAftUqQCmXKNPX5XGBUy8" target="_blank">
   all new and improved plotting and function tutorial </a> to see this new feature in action. 
   This new feature is especially powerful when combined with the new "Copy Data" button to bring 
   the plot data into Excel, Google Sheets, or Numbers. 
</p>
<br />


<em>October 13, 2022</em>
<h4>Plotting Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Many improvements have been made to plotting in EngineeringPaper.xyz. The biggest new feature 
   is the "Copy Data" button that copies all of the plot data to the clipboard where you can 
   then paste it into Excel, Google Sheets, or Numbers. Support for log scaling of the x and/or y axes 
   has also been added. Finally, an insert plot cell button has been added to make it simpler to 
   create a plot. See the <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/TxAftUqQCmXKNPX5XGBUy8" target="_blank">
   plotting and function tutorial</a> to try out these new features.
</p>
<br />


<em>October 3, 2022</em>
<h4>Numerical System Solving Capability Added to System Solve Cells</h4>
<p>
   EngineeringPaper.xyz now supports numerically solving equations and systems
   of equations in situations where the symbolic solver may not be able to find an exact
   solution. See the
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/DeP4bqfF2H5VbRJz3Nd9Re" target="_blank"> 
      updated equation solving tutorial</a>
   sheet to see how to use this new capability. There is also a short
   <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/ZMOhOT7sUR0" target="_blank">numerical solver tutorial video</a>
   available.
</p>
<br />

<em>September 26, 2022</em>
<h4>New System Solve Cell Type Added to EngineeringPaper.xyz</h4>
<p>
   The way EngineeringPaper.xyz handles equation solving has been updated and
   improved by adding a System Solve Cell type. This change makes it possible to
   solve multiple systems of equations in a single sheet and makes it easier to
   choose a particular solution when there are multiple solutions. <strong
      >Existing sheets that make use of equation solving will need to be updated
      to use the new System Solve Cell. See this
      <a
